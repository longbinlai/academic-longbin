GraphScope Interactive is a specialized construction of GraphScope Flex, designed to handle concurrent graph queries at an impressive speed. Its primary goal is to process as many queries as possible within a given timeframe, emphasizing a high query throughput rate. GraphScope Interactive stands on the shoulders of two pivotal pillars:

- GraphScope Flex: GraphScope Flex is a new architecture of GraphScope that provides a solid foundation for GraphScope Interactive. It is designed to handle high-QPS (Queries Per Second) scenarios, making it an ideal base for the high-throughput demands of GraphScope Interactive.

- Record-Breaking Benchmarking Results: GraphScope Interactive is built upon the [record-breaking LDBC SNB Interactive benchmarking results](https://ldbcouncil.org/benchmarks/snb-interactive/), which has achieved a throughput of 33,180.87 ops/s for the benchmarking, making it one of the most efficient systems for graph query processing.
