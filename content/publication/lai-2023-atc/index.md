abstract: Interactive GPM (iGPM) is becoming increasingly important for data scientists to explore graphs in real life, where a series of graph pattern matching (GPM) queries are created and submitted in an interactive manner based on the insights provided by the prior queries. To solve the iGPM problem, three key considerations must be taken into account -- performance, usability and scalability -- namely if results can be returned in a timely manner, if queries can be written in a declarative way without the need of imperative fine-tune, and if it can work on large graphs.
