abstract:   This technical report extends the SIGMOD 2025 paper "A Modular Graph-Native Query Optimization Framework" by providing a comprehensive exposition of \gopt’s advanced technical mechanisms, implementation strategies, and extended evaluations. While the original paper introduced \gopt’s unified intermediate representation (\ir) and demonstrated its performance benefits, this report delves into the framework’s implementation depth: (1) the full specification of \gopt’s optimization rules; (2) a systematic treatment of semantic variations (e.g., homomorphism vs. edge-distinct matching) across query languages and their implications for optimization; (3) the design of GOpt’s Physical integration interface, enabling seamless integration with transactional (Neo4j) and distributed (GraphScope) backends via engine-specific operator customization; and (4) a detailed analysis of plan transformations for LDBC benchmark queries.
