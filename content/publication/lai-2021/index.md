abstract: GraphScope is a system and a set of language extensions that enable a new programming interface for large-scale distributed graph computing. It generalizes previous graph processing frameworks (e.g., Pregel, GraphX) and distributed graph databases (e.g., JanusGraph, Neptune) in two important ways: by exposing a unified programming interface to a wide variety of graph computations such as graph traversal, pattern matching, iterative algorithms and graph neural networks within a high-level programming language;
