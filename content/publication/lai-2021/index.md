abstract: GraphScope is a system and a set of language extensions by exposing a unified programming interface to a wide variety of graph computations such as graph traversal, pattern matching, iterative algorithms and graph neural networks within a high-level programming language; and by supporting the seamless integration of a highly optimized graph engine in a general purpose data-parallel computing system.
