abstract: "While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at single-document queries and conversational workflows, they struggle with progressively exploring, analyzing, and synthesizing large unstructured document sets, such as in literature surveys. We address this challenge -- termed Progressive Document Investigation -- by introducing Graphy, an end-to-end platform that automates data modeling, exploration and high-quality report generation in a user-friendly manner. Graphy comprises an offline Scrapper that transforms raw documents into a structured graph of Fact and Dimension nodes, and an online Surveyor that enables iterative exploration and LLM-driven report generation. We showcase a pre-scrapped graph of over 50,000 papers, demonstrating how Graphy facilitates the literature-survey scenario, with video available at https://youtu.be/uM4nzkAdGlM."
