abstract: GraphScope is a system and a set of language extensions by exposing a unified programming interface to a wide variety of graph computations such as graph traversal, pattern matching, iterative algorithms and graph neural networks within a high-level programming language; and by supporting the seamless integration of a highly optimized graph engine in a general purpose data-parallel computing system. The system automatically handles the parallelization and distributed execution of programs on a cluster of machines. It outperforms current state-of-the-art systems by enabling a separate optimization (or family of optimizations) for each graph operation in one carefully designed coherent framework. We describe the design and implementation of GraphScope and evaluate system performance using several real-world applications.
